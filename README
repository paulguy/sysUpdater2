sysUpdater2 by paulguy

This is a rewrite of sysUpdater based on SafeSysUpdater by cpasjuste.  I was
very careful to consider all possible dangers to see if I could improve
reliability, but it's not possible to consider everything in a black box like
the 3DS.

                              !!!!! WARNING !!!!!
This is currently untested!  Everything else seems to work fine (still may be
bugs there, too!) but the code to actually delete or install anything has not
been tested at all!  Even if this was tested, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  It could
cost you!
                              !!!!! WARNING !!!!!

Build:
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=DevkitArm3DS.cmake .
make

Usage:
Either copy the .3dsx and .smdh to your SD card in a directory under /3ds/ or
install the .cia with your CIA installer of choice.

Copy your CIAs to /updates/ on the SD card.

Run it.

If the exploit doesn't seem to work, try running this or some other application
then quitting back to the menu then running this application.  This seems to be
more reliable, but it can still fail sometimes.


If you want to change the logo (If you're OK with the default, then you're all
ready to go and don't need to bother with this.), you'll need to create a
320x240 image, put it in /logo.png then process it with toctrfb.c.  This can be
done by first building the tool by running buildtools.sh then running
convertlogo.sh both within the tools directory.  It will be converted to RGB565
with no real processing or anything (it literally just cuts off the low bits),
so you should make sure it'll look alright.
